# about list rendering we should know
- About the key
    - Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed
    - Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However they donâ€™t need to be globally unique
- DO NOT use index as key unless:
    - The item in the list do not have a unique id
    - The list is a static list and will not change
    - The list will never be ordered or filtered
- What will happe when we use index for key
    - Situation: append new element in front of the array
    - Result: List will update but the values are error
